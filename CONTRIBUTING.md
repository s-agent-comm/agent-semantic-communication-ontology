# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from all members of the community! This document outlines how you can participate and help improve the Semantic Agent Ontology.

## Getting Started

*   **Join the conversation:** The best place to start is by reviewing the materials in the `discussions/` directory and joining the W3C Community Group (see `README.md` for the link).
